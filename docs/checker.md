# Oska checker report

`oskac check <file.osk> [--format=json] [--release]` type-checks one file against the embedded prelude. The rules it enforces are in the "Type checking" section of [`design.md`](design.md). This page describes what it prints.

The exit code is non-zero when there are diagnostics. Without `--format=json`, diagnostics go to stderr and the authority report to stdout, one function per line, such as `fn main: Stdout (io), FsRead (fs)` or `fn add: pure`.

Function bodies are not checked yet; only type and trait names in signatures and declarations are resolved.

## Report

```json
{
  "diagnostics": [
    {"code":"E0200","message":"unknown type `Strng`; did you mean `String`?","span":{"start":8,"end":13},"fix":{"message":"replace with `String`","edits":[{"span":{"start":8,"end":13},"replacement":"String"}]}}
  ],
  "functions": [
    {"name":"count_lines","authority":["FsRead"],"via":[{"param":"fs","capabilities":["FsRead"]}],"pure":false},
    {"name":"Logger.log","authority":["Stdout"],"via":[{"param":"self","capabilities":["Stdout"]}],"pure":false},
    {"name":"add","authority":[],"via":[],"pure":true}
  ]
}
```

- **`diagnostics`**, in source order. Each uses the same object as parser diagnostics (see [`ast.md`](ast.md)): `code`, `message`, `span` (byte offsets), and `fix` when the repair is unambiguous. A parse error is reported alone, with an empty `functions`.
- **`functions`**: one entry per function and `impl` method, in source order. The report is produced even when there are diagnostics.
  - `name`: the function's name, or `Type.method` for a method.
  - `authority`: the built-in capabilities the function can reach, in order of first appearance, without repeats. `cap` types are expanded through their fields, and type arguments are expanded, so `List<Stdout>` reaches `Stdout`. Attenuated capabilities keep their names, such as `FsRead`.
  - `via`: each capability-bearing parameter and the capabilities it supplies, in parameter order. A method's receiver appears as `self`. A `cap fn` parameter is listed with no capabilities, because a closure's capabilities are not written in its type.
  - `pure`: `true` when no parameter, the receiver included, is capability-bearing.

## The prelude

The prelude is Oska source, `crates/oska-check/src/prelude.osk`, parsed with `parse_prelude`. It declares the built-in capabilities as `#[capability]` structs with private fields, the core types (`Option`, `Result`, `List`, `Path`, `Args`, `IoError`) and the core traits (`Eq`, `Hash`, `Display`, `From`). The primitive types (`Int`, `I8` to `I64`, `U8` to `U64`, `Bool`, `String`) and `()` are built into the checker. User code cannot redeclare any of these names.

## Diagnostic codes

| Code | Meaning | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E0200` | Unknown type or trait name. A qualified path such as `sql.Query` is unknown until `std.*` modules exist. | Replace the name with the single closest declared name, when one is close enough. |
| `E0201` | A trait where a type is expected (`x: Display`), or a type where a trait is expected (`T: Int`). | None. |
| `E0202` | A type or trait name declared twice in the module, or one that redeclares a prelude name. | None. |
